# Stepper Motor Control using Arduino

## 📌 Project Description
This project focuses on the interfacing and control of a stepper motor using an Arduino microcontroller. It demonstrates precise speed and direction control through programmed step sequences. The project was verified using embedded system simulation tools.

## ⚙️ Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- Stepper Motor
- Motor Driver (ULN2003 / L298N)
- External Power Supply

## 🧠 Working Principle
The Arduino generates digital pulse sequences that energize the stepper motor coils in a predefined order. By controlling the timing and sequence of these pulses, accurate angular motion, speed variation, and direction control are achieved.
